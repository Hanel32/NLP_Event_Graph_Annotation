PRISON {SENTENCE}1 FOR MANHATTAN FORTUNETELLER

NEW YORK - Sylvia Mitchell, the Manhattan fortuneteller whose ornate Greenwich Village parlor and {air}2 of uptown sophistication {attracted}3 well-to-do, distraught clients who {preferred}4 the finer things in {life}5, was {sentenced}6 to 5 to 15 years in prison on Thursday, a month after a jury {convicted}7 her of grand {larceny}8.

In {handing}9 down the {sentence}10, Justice Gregory Carro of state Supreme Court {acknowledged}11 that the {penalty}12 was {harsher}13 than that {requested}14 by prosecutors at Thursday’s {hearing}15. The Manhattan district attorney’s office had {requested}16 a {sentence}17 of three to nine years in prison.

“You had a perfect {setup}18,” Carro {said}19. “We {have}20 lots of con artists here in New York City,” he {said}21, {citing}22 three-card monte dealers and those who {pretend}23 their glasses were just {broken}24 by a stranger who {bumped}25 into them on the street.

But Mitchell {lured}26 “someone who is having some dramatic {stress}27 in their {life}28, some great {problems}29 they were {going}30 through, {looking}31 for some kind of {help}32,” the judge {said}33.

Mitchell, 39, {began}34 to {weep}35 upon {entering}36 the courtroom, {handcuffed}37 and somewhat {haggard}38 after a month in jail on Rikers Island and {glimpsing}39 a row of mostly elderly men, presumably relatives, who were {sitting}40 with the father of her two teenage children.

She {told}41 the judge she was {sorry}42 for what she had {done}43. “I {want}44 to {go}45 back to school and {start}46 a new {profession}47 and {start}48 my {life}49 again,” she {said}50.

She was {ordered}51 to {pay}52 more than $110,000 in {restitution}53 to the two victims in the {case}54, something her lawyer, Kenneth Gribetz, {said}55 he {came}56 {prepared}57 to {do}58 with a check from an escrow account. He {said}59 he {planned}60 to {appeal}61 the {sentence}62, which he {said}63 was overly {harsh}64 given that prosecutors, long before {trial}65, had {offered}66 her a plea {deal}67 involving no jail {time}68. She {refused}69 the {offer}70.

Both victims, Lee Choong and Debra Saalfield, {wrote}71 letters {describing}72 the {pain}73 caused by their {dealings}74 with Mitchell. Both had {approached}75 her during periods of romantic {upheaval}76 in their {lives}77. Both {testified}78 against Mitchell, and in {doing}79 so, {admitted}80 that in hindsight, all her {talk}81 of {curses}82 and evil spirits seemed {far-fetched}83, but at the time, {unsettling}84. Choong {said}85 she was {drawn}86 to the parlor, called Zena on Seventh Avenue South, because it was {plush}87 and relatively {pricey}88.

Saalfield {said}89 that the news media {coverage}90 of the {case}91 had further {hurt}92 her. At a recent wedding rehearsal {dinner}93 that she {attended}94, she {wrote}95, “one of the guests {stared}96 at me at great length and put an 'L’ for loser on her face while {looking}97 at me.”
