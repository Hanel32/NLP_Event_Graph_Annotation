ARIK EINSTEIN, BELOVED ISRAELI SINGER, {DIES}1 AT 74

JERUSALEM - Arik Einstein, an Israeli singer and songwriter whose blend of folk and rock {helped}2 {shape}3 a new Hebrew popular culture and whose ballads became modern Israeli anthems, {died}4 Tuesday in Tel Aviv. He was 74.

His {death}5, of an aortic {aneurysm}6, was {announced}7 by Gabriel Barbash, director of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, where Einstein was {taken}8 after {collapsing}9 at home.

“There will be nobody to {sing}10 for us anymore,” Barbash {told}11 reporters and fans who had {gathered}12 outside the hospital Tuesday night, {setting}13 the tone for a national {outpouring}14 of {grief}15 and {nostalgia}16.

On Wednesday, an estimated crowd of 10,000 {poured}17 into Rabin Square, the Tel Aviv plaza {named}18 for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, where Einstein’s coffin {lay}19 in state. His rendition of a modern Israeli ballad, “Cry for You,” became one of the motifs of the period after Rabin’s {assassination}20 in 1995.

“His songs {accompanied}21 us at all the {stations}22 of our {lives}23 - in our {loves}24 and {disappointments}25, our {ups}26 and {downs}27,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu {said}28 at a memorial {ceremony}29 in the square, {adding}30 that Einstein {symbolized}31 “the land of Israel that is beautiful, true and pure.”

Einstein, who {began}32 his recording {career}33 in the 1960s, {released}34 nearly 50 albums, sometimes in {collaboration}35 with other artists. While he largely {retired}36 from the stage several decades ago and was little {known}37 internationally, his {popularity}38 at home barely {waned}39. Last year he was {voted}40 best Israeli singer of all time by readers of the popular newspaper Yediot Aharonot. Einstein {helped}41 {forge}42 an authentic Hebrew rock culture with popular songs like “Me and You” and “Fly, Baby Bird.”

“His sound was {new}43,” Motti Regev, an Israeli sociologist {specializing}44 in popular music and culture, {told}45 Israel Radio on Wednesday. “Israeli music was mostly {connected}46 to military bands and ideological music. He {sought}47 how to {connect}48 to popular music in the world, to rock, and {connect}49 it to what was {taking}50 place in Israel.”

Einstein’s music, {crossing}51 generations and ethnic boundaries, was a comforting and unifying force in a diverse and often divided country, and the embodiment of an older, more genteel Israel that some {say}52 does not {exist}53 anymore. He was also {known}54 for his {appearances}55 in movies and comedy skits.

Arieh Einstein was {born}56 in Tel Aviv on Jan. 3, 1939, the only child of Yaakov and Devorah Einstein. His father was an actor. He became Israel’s high-jump champion as a boy and performed his military {service}57 as a member of an infantry brigade entertainment troupe.

He {married}58 Alona Shochet in 1963, and they had two daughters. The couple {divorced}59, {remarried}60 and {divorced}61 again. She {died}62 in 2006. Einstein had two more children, a son and a daughter, with his second wife, Sima Eliyahu, an actress. She and his four children {survive}63 him.

{Described}64 by friends and acquaintances as modest and bashful, Einstein {stopped}65 {performing}66 for live audiences in the early 1980s after being seriously {injured}67 in a car {accident}68. Although he {continued}69 {recording}70, he largely {retired}71 from the public eye in recent years. But the newspaper Maariv {announced}72 this week that Einstein would {begin}73 {writing}74 a weekly column for its weekend supplement. He had put the final {touches}75 on his first - and last - column in the hours before he {died}76.
