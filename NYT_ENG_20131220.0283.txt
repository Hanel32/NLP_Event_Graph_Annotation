NIGELLA LAWSON ASSISTANTS {FOUND}1 NOT {GUILTY}2 OF {FRAUD}3

This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of a story that will {appear}4 in tomorrow’s New York Times.);

LONDON - Two Italians sisters who {spent}5 more than $1 million on celebrity chef Nigella Lawson’s credit cards were {acquitted}6 of {fraud}7 {charges}8 Friday by a London jury.

The sisters, Francesca, 35, and Elisabetta Grillo, 41, {testified}9 that Lawson had given them {permission}10 to {spend}11 as they {liked}12 on the household credit cards in {exchange}13 for {keeping}14 {quiet}15 about her cocaine {use}16.

Lawson, 53, was {compelled}17 under {oath}18 to {admit}19 to {using}20 cocaine after now former husband, Charles Saatchi, 70, {called}21 her “Higella” in a private {email}22 that was {revealed}23 in {court}24. He later {said}25 he {regretted}26 the {email}27 and never {saw}28 her {using}29 drugs, but she {accused}30 him of “intimate {terrorism}31” and intense {jealousy}32, and with {trying}33 to {destroy}34 her reputation.

The couple {divorced}35 in July after he was {photographed}36 {squeezing}37 her nose and {gripping}38 her by the throat at a London restaurant. That {incident}39 and the fraud {case}40 involving the private life of the celebrity chef provided much fodder for Britain’s tabloids.

Lawson {denied}41 {abusing}42 drugs, {testifying}43 that she first {used}44 cocaine while {caring}45 for her first husband, John Diamond, when he was terminally {ill}46 with {cancer}47; he {died}48 in 2001.

After the {verdict}49, Lawson {said}50 in a {statement}51, “I did my civic {duty}52, only to be maliciously {vilified}53 without the {right}54 to {respond}55.”

Prosecutors {told}56 the court that over just four months in 2012, the sisters {spent}57 thousands of dollars in personal {charges}58 on household credit cards, including {trips}59 to New York, hotel {stays}60 and designer leather goods, as well as clothes from labels such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Vivienne Westwood.

Neither sister was {in}61 the courtroom to {hear}62 the {verdict}63. Elisabetta Grillo apparently suffered a panic {attack}64 in {court}65 Thursday and {collapsed}66 three times Friday, once {in}67 the courthouse.

The Grillos were each {charged}68 with a single count of {fraud}69. The sisters were {described}70 by one of their lawyers, Richard Cannon, as “naturally {relieved}71” by the {verdict}72.
