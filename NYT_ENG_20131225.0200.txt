Ghost {haunts}1 pardon {process}2

ALBANY, N.Y. – While Christmas marks a traditional time during which governors {commute}3 the {sentences}4 of a handful of 
prisoners, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has {granted}5 none since {taking}6 office in 2011.

As of Tuesday, Cuomo has given no {commutations}7, in which prisoners are {released}8; or {pardons}9, in which {convictions}10
are {nullified}11.

{That}12’s in contrast with the previous four governors, including Cuomo’s father, Mario M. Cuomo.

The elder Cuomo, Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson all granted {clemency}13 during their {terms}14 as governor.

Andrew Cuomo hasn’t {closed}15 the door on the {idea}16, but he’s made no {promises}17. When {asked}18 if any {clemency}19 
was forthcoming this year, spokesman Richard Azzopardi {said}20 that ''all {requests}21 are {reviewed}22.''

There doesn’t appear to be a public {outcry}23 over {clemencies}24, and a governor can grant {them}25 at any time.

But reform activists have taken {note}26 of the lack of {action}27. ''Every year, I {ask}28 him to {use}29 his {power}30 of 
executive {clemency}31. He has not {used}32 {any}33 yet,'' {said}34 Anthony Papa, spokesman for the Drug Policy Alliance, 
which {pushes}35 to {reform}36 drug laws.

''Historically, other governors have done {this}37 around Christmas,'' {added}38 John O’Hara, a Brooklyn lawyer who was 
{convicted}39 of voter {fraud}40 in a convoluted {case}41 involving a {battle}42 he had with the borough’s Democratic machine.
He has since {regained}43 his {ability}44 to {practice}45 law, but {continues}46 to {seek}47 a {pardon}48 for his felony 
{conviction}49.

Papa, who was {serving}50 time on a drug {conviction}51 and was granted a {commutation}52 by former Gov. George Pataki, {said}53
he {believes}54 Cuomo, like some other politicians, has been {influenced}55 by the ''Willie Horton {Syndrome}56,'' which dates
to the 1980s.

Horton was {serving}57 a life {term}58 for {murder}59 in Massachusetts when he {left}60 prison under a {furlough}61 and committed
an armed {robbery}62 and {rape}63.

Michael Dukakis was governor of Massachusetts at the time and George H.W. Bush’s {campaign}64 {exploited}65 the Horton {incident}66
to make Dukakis, a Democrat, {look}67 {soft}68 on {crime}69 during the 1988 presidential {race}70. Bush, a Republican, {won}71.

Papa {believes}72 Cuomo {worries}73 that if a {commutation}74 were to {turn}75 out badly, {it}76 could {come}77 back to {haunt}78
him, possibly in a presidential {contest}79 down the road.

''The Democrats have been {scared}80,'' {agreed}81 Jim Murphy, a former jail chaplain and Capital Region prison-reform activist.
''They are more {vulnerable}82 to the tough-on-crime {talk}83.''

Cuomo’s Democratic predecessors, though, have given {commutations}84 and {pardons}85.

David Paterson granted three {commutations}86 and 35 {pardons}87; Eliot Spitzer granted one {pardon}88.

Republican Gov. George Pataki gave 32 {commutations}89, largely for Rockefeller Drug Law {cases}90, and one posthumous 
{pardon}91 to comedian Lenny Bruce.

Democrat Mario Cuomo gave 37 {commutations}92 and Hugh Carey, who {served}93 through 1982 (pre-Willie {Horton}94) gave
155 {commutations}95 and {pardons}96.
