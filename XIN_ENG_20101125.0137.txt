IFC {signs}4 {deal}5 to {expand}6 insurance to farmers in East Africa

NAIROBI, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- International Finance Corporation
(IFC) has {signed}7 {agreements}8 with three partners to {expand}9 {access}10
to insurance to thousands of farmers and livestock herders in
Kenya and Rwanda to {help}11 {protect}12 their crops, animals and
livelihoods from weather-related {risks}13 and natural {disasters}14.

IFC, through the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF), will
{confer}15 grants totaling roughly 4.1 million U. S. dollars to the
Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture/UAP Insurance
weather index insurance {initiative}16 in Kenya; the International
Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Livestock index insurance
{project}17 in northern Kenya; and the MicroEnsure weather index
insurance {project}18 in Rwanda.   "These {partnerships}19 {highlight}20
IFC's {commitment}21 to {expanding}22 insurance and other financial
products where they are {needed}23 most in Africa. The Global Index
Insurance Facility will {facilitate}24 farmers' {access}25 to credit,
leading to increased {productivity}26, {improved}27 livelihoods and
greater food {security}28," Jean Philippe Prosper, IFC Director for
Eastern and Southern Africa {said}29.   "We are {grateful}30 to the
donors that have generously {provided}31 funding and to our partners
for {supporting}32 this {program}33."

The grants, the first three {provided}34 under the GIIF {program}35, will
help {bring}36 weather-related, index-based insurance to about 35,
000 farmers and 5,000 livestock herders in East Africa over the
next three years.   "The {implementation}37 of these three first GIIF
{projects}38 in Kenya and Rwanda will {support}39 the {development}40 of new
insurance products and will {increase}41 {expertise}42 in this field,
which will {benefit}43 smallholders and livestock keepers {affected}44 by
climatic {events}45," he {said}46.  "In addition to the GIIF, the
European Union is providing further {financing}47 to the ILRI
Livestock Insurance {project}48 in Kenya through the 10th European
Development Fund, Kenya Rural Development Project that will {start}49
in 2011."

IFC will {confer}50 a grant of up to 2.4 million dollars on Syngenta
Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, which {expects}51 to {help}52
{insure}53 20,000 farmers in Kenya over the next three years

IFC will {confer}54 a grant of up to 154,000 dollars on the ILRI,
which {expects}55 to {help}56 {insure}57 5,000 livestock herders in northern
Kenya over the next two years.

IFC will {confer}58 a grant of up to 1.6 million dollars on
MicroEnsure, which {expects}59 to {insure}60 15,000 farmers in Rwanda
over the next three years.

IFC's GIIF {program}61 was {established}62 in 2009 to {assist}63 the
{development}64 of index-based insurance for natural {disasters}65 and
weather {risks}66 in developing countries, where insurance is rarely
{available}67.

The grants will {fund}68 advisory {activities}69, including local
capacity {building}70, infrastructure {development}71, product
{development}72, and {development}73 of local insurance companies'
{capacity}74 to {provide}75 index-based insurance products.

Index-based insurance {insures}76 against catastrophic {events}77, such
as wind {storms}78 or {droughts}79, depending on {their}80 {severity}81.

Index-linked insurance products {eliminate}82 the {need}83 for insurance
companies to individually {verify}84 claims, {reducing}85 transaction
costs and making it {easier}86 for the products and {services}87 to be
{offered}88 to rural communities and in frontier regions.

The European Union {committed}89 24.5 million euros as the first
donor to the GIIF Trust Fund.

The fund is also {supported}90 by Japan's Ministry of Finance with an
initial grant of 2 million dollars, and the Dutch Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, which {provided}91 funding to {establish}92 the
facility.
